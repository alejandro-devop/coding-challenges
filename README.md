# Coding challenges

Hi coder, the following is my personal log for code challenges, programming language is not important, the most important is defying your self, learn and try to have fun!

There are a simple rules to follow on this challenges: 

1. your solution for the challenge must be inside a folder with your github user name.
2. the folder must contain an entry file with the solution (`main.java`, `index.js`, `main.cs`, `solution.py`).
3. The challenges must be console applications.
4. (optional) A Readme file with instructions to run your program (If there is any special requirements)

### Example
```bash
# Project folder structure

|_ challenge No. 1
|   |_ alejandro.devop
|   |   |_ index.js
|   |   |_ Readme.md
|   |
|   |_ agudelont
|   |   |_ main.java
|   |
|   |_ kravmaga01

```
